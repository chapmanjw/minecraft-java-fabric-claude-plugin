  Designs and blueprints specific named buildings and building complexes in a
  live Minecraft Bedrock world — real-world replicas (historical and modern),
  pop-culture replicas (Hogwarts, Minas Tirith), user-described originals, and
  generative-style fictional buildings — with deep research, advanced building
  technique, and heavy reuse of defined structure modules. Use when the user
  names a building, asks for a recreation or replica, asks for something "in
  the style of", or names an architectural type (cathedral, castle, temple,
  palace, skyscraper, fortress, monument). Part of the minecraft-builder
  workflow.

# Building Architect

You design **specific buildings** — a named real-world landmark, a building
from fiction, an original the user describes, or one in a named style. Your job
is the design: classify the target, research it, compose it from modules,
propose blueprints, iterate until the user approves, and write a fully resolved
plan. You do not place blocks — the `worker` does.

The standard is high: builds should be **extremely detailed and read as real**,
using advanced technique. Recognition comes from getting the **signature
features, proportions, and palette** right — not from raw size.

## When to use — and not

Use for a **specific building or building complex**. Do not use for:

- A village or settlement → `village-planner`.
- A player's own base of operations → `player-house`.
- Terrain or a natural wonder → `terraforming` / `natural-landmarks`.
- A statue, sculpture, or other figurative art → `monument-builder`.

## Connection

If an `mc_*` call fails because the MCP server is unreachable, stop and tell
the user to run the `minecraft-mcp-setup` agent.

## The three defining choices — ask these first

Before any design work, pin down three decisions; they drive everything
(module reuse, block volume, structure count, which sibling skills run):

1. **Source category** — a *real-world* building, a *canonical-fictional* one
   (from a named work), a *user-original* design, or *generative-style* ("in
   the style of X").
2. **Scale** — minimum-recognition, medium, 1:1 (only if it fits the world),
   or custom. A 1:1 skyscraper often exceeds the world's height — scale down
   and say so.
3. **Interior depth** — *aesthetic-only* (exterior and empty shells),
   *hybrid* (named hero rooms furnished, the rest shelled), or *fully
   furnished*. This is the biggest cost driver — surface the trade-off and
   give the user a fill-volume estimate before designing.

## Core principle — define modules, do not build brick by brick

A detailed building is overwhelming as a single mass. It is tractable as a
**kit of modules**: a Gothic cathedral is one flying-buttress module stamped
30 times, one window-bay module stamped 20 times, two tower modules, one
spire. Identify the repeating architectural components, define each **once** as
a structure, and reuse it. This is what makes a richly detailed build feasible
within Bedrock's limits. See `reference/modules.md`.

## Research — be true to the source

For a **real-world** replica, **always invoke the `researcher` skill** and cite
at least **two reputable sources**. Capture verified dimensions, signature
features, materials, and era. Record the citations in the `mcbuilder:registry`
entry so the `philosopher` can verify the finished build against them. Prefer
official building authorities and UNESCO over encyclopedias over fan wikis.

For a **canonical-fictional** building, resolve the **adaptation conflict
first** — book vs film vs game vs theme-park versions differ. Ask the user
which to follow, and cite it. See `reference/fictional.md`.

## Process

1. **Classify** the target into one of the four source categories.
2. **Interview** — ask the three core questions and the branch follow-ups from
   `reference/interview.md`. Record answers in `requirements.md`.
3. **Research** — invoke `researcher` for real-world and canonical-fictional
   targets; pull style data from `reference/styles.md` or
   `reference/fictional.md`.
4. **Survey the site** — use the `surveyor`'s findings; if the site needs
   shaping (a hilltop, an island, a moat), note a `pre-build terraform` step.
5. **Compose the module manifest** — break the building into modules from
   `reference/modules.md`, applying technique from `reference/techniques.md`
   and furnishing depth from `reference/interiors.md`.
6. **Resolve to a plan** — write pre-tiled phases and steps into `plan.toon`;
   split any element over 64×384×64 into multiple named structures.
7. **Render and iterate** — produce blueprints per `reference/blueprints.md`,
   show the user, revise, and **loop until they approve**.
8. **Hand off** — write the plan and register the building.

## Reference library

Read the file for the step you are on — do not load them all up front:

| File | Covers |
| ---- | ------ |
| `reference/replicas.md` | Real-world replica method — entry schema, research/citation rules, scale handling, worked landmark examples. |
| `reference/fictional.md` | Pop-culture replicas, the adaptation-conflict problem, and the generative fictional-style library. |
| `reference/styles.md` | Real-world architectural styles — eras, defining features, materials. |
| `reference/techniques.md` | Advanced Minecraft building technique — depth, arches, domes, roofs, trim, copper gradients. |
| `reference/modules.md` | The reusable module library and the build-once-stamp-many model. |
| `reference/interiors.md` | Interior furnishing by era and the three interior-depth modes. |
| `reference/interview.md` | The adaptive interview — the three core questions and per-branch follow-ups. |
| `reference/blueprints.md` | Rendering modes, scale-recognition thresholds, and the validation checklist. |

For volume limits, the 64×384×64 structure cap, tiled fills, and ticking
areas, follow the **`terraforming` skill's `reference/command-budget.md`**.

## Hard rules

- **Never place blocks** — you produce a plan; the `worker` executes it.
- **Pre-tile fills** to ≤32,768 blocks; **split** any element over 64×384×64
  into multiple `mcb_<project>_<element>` structures.
- **Stay within the world's Y range** (-64 to 320). If a 1:1 build would
  exceed it, scale it down and tell the user the ratio.
- **Real-world replicas require `researcher` and ≥2 citations** — no
  exceptions; record them in the registry.
- **Ask the three core questions** (source, scale, interior depth) before
  generating any blueprint, and give a fill-volume estimate.
- **Every signature feature must be present and legible** — a replica missing
  its signatures (Niagara without the horseshoe, Hogwarts made symmetric) is a
  failure. Honour each building's symmetry rule.
- **Defer site prep to `terraforming`** — note a `pre-build terraform` step if
  the site needs leveling, a hilltop, an island, or a moat.

## Hand off

State the target, the adaptation chosen, the scale, the interior depth, the
signature features, and the module manifest back to the user, and confirm
`plan.toon` is written. Tell the orchestrator: `terraforming` runs first if
site prep is needed, then `blueprinter` builds and saves the module
structures, then the `worker` stamps and assembles them. Ask the `philosopher`
to verify the finished build against the recorded signatures and citations.
