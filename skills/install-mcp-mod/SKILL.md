# Install the MCP mod + Fabric API (Step 2 of 4)

This is **Phase 2** of the four-phase Minecraft Java MCP setup. It assumes
Phase 1 (`setup-fabric`) is done: Fabric is installed and the `mods/` folder
exists. You should have, written down:

- the chosen **Minecraft version** (e.g. `26.1.2`);
- the **mods-folder path** (single-player) or the **`<server>` root** with its
  `mods/` folder (dedicated server).

If either is missing, get it before continuing. Work interactively — confirm
each download before moving on.

## What you're installing

The MCP server is delivered as a **Fabric mod**. It needs exactly two jars in
`mods/`, both matching the same Minecraft version:

1. **The MCP mod** — `minecraft-fabric-mcp-<modver>+<mc-version>.jar`.
2. **Fabric API** — the mod's only dependency.

> **Match the Minecraft version on both jars.** A jar built for `26.1.2` will
> not load on `1.21.11`, and vice versa. The version suffix after the `+` must
> equal the version chosen in Phase 1.

## Step 1 — Download the MCP mod jar

From the mod's releases:
<https://github.com/chapmanjw/minecraft-java-fabric-mcp-server/releases>

Pick the asset whose filename ends in **`+<your-mc-version>.jar`** — e.g.
`minecraft-fabric-mcp-0.1.0+26.1.2.jar` for Minecraft 26.1.2. Pin to a specific
release tag rather than tracking `latest`, so the version stays in lockstep
with Minecraft and Fabric API.

## Step 2 — Download the matching Fabric API jar

From Modrinth: <https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions>

Filter by your Minecraft version and download the Fabric API jar for it — e.g.
`fabric-api-0.149.1+26.1.2.jar`. The exact Fabric API build doesn't have to be
the newest, but its Minecraft version must match.

## Step 3 — Put both jars in `mods/`

Copy **both** jars into the `mods/` folder from Phase 1.

**Single-player** — the platform path:

| OS | Path |
| -- | ---- |
| Windows | `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods/` |
| Linux | `~/.minecraft/mods/` |

**Dedicated server** — `<server>/mods/`:

```sh
mkdir -p /opt/fabric-mcp/mods
# copy both jars into it
```

The folder should now contain exactly these two jars (plus any other mods the
user already runs):

```
mods/
├── fabric-api-0.149.1+26.1.2.jar
└── minecraft-fabric-mcp-0.1.0+26.1.2.jar
```

Confirm with the user that both files are present and that the version suffixes
match each other and the Minecraft version.

## Step 4 — Quick load check (optional but recommended)

If the user wants to confirm the mod loads before configuring it:

- **Single-player:** launch the Fabric profile and load any world.
- **Dedicated server:** `java -Xmx2G -jar fabric-server-launch.jar nogui`.

In the log, look for the mod's startup lines:

```
[minecraft_fabric_mcp] MCP server config loaded from .../config/minecraft_fabric_mcp/config.json
[minecraft_fabric_mcp] Registered N MCP tools (M skipped due to version/module constraints)
[minecraft_fabric_mcp] MCP server listening at http://127.0.0.1:8765 (...)
```

Seeing the `listening` line means the mod loaded and the embedded MCP server
started. (Phase 3 covers configuring it and verifying `/healthz`.) If the game
crashes on load, the usual cause is a version mismatch between the mod jar, the
Fabric API jar, and Minecraft — re-check the `+<version>` suffixes.

## Wrap up

Confirm with the user:

- [ ] MCP mod jar for the chosen Minecraft version is in `mods/`.
- [ ] Matching Fabric API jar is in `mods/`.
- [ ] Both version suffixes match each other and the Minecraft version.
- [ ] (Optional) The mod loaded and logged the MCP `listening` line.

Hand off: Phase 2 is done — the mod is installed. The next step configures the
MCP server (`config.json`), launches it, and verifies it's reachable. Offer to
continue with the **`setup-mcp-server`** skill now.
